"""Oracle scoring harness for the GS renderers.

Scores a renderer arm per-pixel against golden frames produced by the software
renderer, over a corpus of GS dumps. This is the correctness gate for the renderer
work: eyeball review is banned by charter, so every claim of "renders correctly"
is a number produced here.

GS dump replay is nondeterministic run-to-run (thread timing changes transfer
interleaving on some dumps), so nothing is compared raw: the golden build runs the
software renderer N times and records which frames are byte-stable across runs, a
score run does the same for the arm under test, and only frames stable in BOTH arms
are compared. The stable fraction is itself a gated metric -- a drop in stability is
triaged as a bug, because it usually is one.

Every differing frame also carries a **perceptual severity profile** from
`gs_perceptual.py` -- a named defect class ("GLOBAL TONE SHIFT", "THIN
GEOMETRY", "LOCALISED DEFECT") beside the raw percentages. That channel is
REPORTING ONLY and never touches `pass`: the level metric remains the gate. It
exists because pixel counts do not rank the way people do -- a full-screen
exposure shift moves 81% of pixels and reads as mild, while a dropped polygon
moves 1.5% and is the first thing an eye lands on. It is what a recorded quality
trade is reviewed with. `--no-perceptual` turns it off.

⚠️ This harness compares PRESENTED frames -- the `*_frame*.png` that gsrunner writes
when given `-dumpdir` alone. It does NOT compare `-dump f` output, which is the
per-draw debugger writing internal render targets. Those targets are sized by each
renderer's own allocation policy and legitimately differ between arms: on one
letterboxed title the same frame dumps 640x415 under sw and 641x800-varying under
classic, neither of which is a bug. Reaching for `-dump f` to investigate a score
from here produces arms that disagree about frame geometry and an inviting, wrong
conclusion. The tell that you are off the rails is that
`score_frame_arrays` reports a shape mismatch as an explicit error, so any run that
produced real percentages was comparing equally-sized frames.

Stated generally, because this harness has now paid for it twice: prove you are
comparing the artifact you think you are, the same way you prove each arm really is
the renderer it claims to be.

Subcommands:
  golden    build/refresh golden frames + stability manifests for a corpus
  score     run one dump under an arm and score it against its golden
  corpus    score a whole corpus, emit a scorecard JSON, gate
  selftest  prove the scorer catches an injected 1-level/1% shift (no runner needed)

Renderer VARIANTS (what gets executed, verified by effect against the renderer
identity line in the emulog rather than trusted from the command line):
  sw       -renderer sw       expect no variant identity line
  classic  -renderer vulkan    expect "GS: Classic renderer active"

Two variants, because this tree has two renderers. The classic variant passes no
`-variant` setting: that is the configuration real users run, and it is what prints
the identity line the verify-by-effect check reads.

An ARM is a label, not necessarily a variant. The integration suite's `arms.conf`
maps an arm name onto a variant plus extra runner flags, so that a settings A/B
(one binary against itself with `-set Section/Key=Value` flipped) is two arms rather
than two renderers. `--variant` names the variant when it is not the arm's own name,
and `--runner-flags` carries the arm's extra flags into every runner launch. Both
land in the scorecard, so a flagged score can never be mistaken for an unflagged one.
Without them a flagged arm is timed with its flags and scored without them, which is
a scorecard describing a configuration nobody ran.

Golden layout (lives beside the dumps, outside any repo -- goldens are ~1 GB):
