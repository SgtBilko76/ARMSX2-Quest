	/// The ring's whole model is "a range is free once the command buffer that was recording when
	/// it was committed has completed", and that holds as long as the only reader is that command
	/// buffer. A caller that stages once and then keeps recording across a SUBMISSION breaks it:
	/// the range is tracked against the first submission, which retires first, and the ring then
	/// hands the same bytes out again while the later submissions are still reading them. Worse
	/// than a wrap-round overwrite, because UpdateGPUPosition's "the GPU caught up" case resets
	/// the whole ring to offset zero the moment the tracked position equals the write position, so
	/// the very next staging lands on top of the live data.
	///
	/// Calling this at each submission boundary walks the range's tracked fence forward with the
	/// recording, so it ends up on the last submission that actually reads it. It only ever moves
	/// a fence FORWARD, so it can delay a reuse and never permit one.
	///
	/// Nothing on this branch stages across a submission yet -- the classic renderer stages a
	/// draw's vertices and records the draw with no submission in between, which is exactly the
	/// shape the ring's own rule assumes. A pass planner that stages a whole frame before opening
	/// its first pass does not, and has to call this at every cut.
